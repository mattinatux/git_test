data key attributes
    - remnany from wild west of html days when
        people made up whatever they wanted
        as tag attributes.
    - IF you want to make up your own attribute,
        (think <img src="">, where src is an
        attribute), it has to be preceeded by
        data-.
    EX: <img src="" data-key="whatever">
